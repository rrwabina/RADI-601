Health IT in Clinical Settings

Section 1: EHR Systems/Hospital Information Systems
    - functionality
    - gradual approach, it depends on the complexity of the system 
    - Scanned medical records can be considered as EHR. Physician notes are also considered as EHR.
    - However, they vary on the importance of the weight of the information regarding the patient's health status
    - Even EHRs are not scanned but typed, they can be structured or not structured. So we need NLP
    - But NLP has some limitations due to the bilingual nature. Not to mention, some medical terms are combination of English + limitations
    - These limitation can cause confusion to the patients and medical staff. 
    - The NLP needs to understand the problems related to medical texts in EHRs.

    We aspire to have EHRs to be typed - termed as fully-electronic. 

    Computerized (Physician/Provider) Order Entry (CPOE)
        - Order systems of nurses, doctors, and other medical staff 
        - Physicians enters medication, lab, imaging orders online. The nurse/pharamcy process these orders ==> Considered part of the EHR / HIS 
            - In some cases, the nurses have to review the orders first before medication list flows into the pharmacy 
        - Medication orders are the most complex because you need to consider the medication process, intakes, and other information 
        - Advantage of CPOE: No handwriting, completeness, clarity, no transcription errors 
        - Example:
            - IPD: Morphone 5mg  stat (immediately) | No route (IV/IM) -- it could have an effect on how long would the drug take effect on the patient's body
                - Skipping the route can lead to errors 
                - Therefore, completeness is important.
                - Fields: Drug Name, Drug Form (Units: tablet | capsule | syrup), Strength, Ampule, Dose, Route, Frequency, Time (Stat)
        - Ordering, Transcription, Dispensing, Administration --> No transcription errors 
        - Streamlines workflow, increases efficiency
            - Parallel - doctors enter the drug in CPOE system, the order will proceed to the pharmacy right away. SIMULTANEOUS 
            - Once the doctors finish the medical examination, the patient can pay the medicine and get their order in the pharmacy. 
            - This is much efficient and fast. 
        
        - ISSUES OF CPOE 
            - Frustration of medical doctors since doctors are not trained as clerks 
                - Hence, this is an Added Value Work for doctors. However, this should be the doctors' jobs to ensure safe prescription 
            - Regardless if you are new or accustomed to the system, some doctors have reduced productivity if they do CPOE
                - In some cases, there are minor changes in the medication. Hence, doctors can import the previous medication orders, adjust, and confirm it. 
                - If it was a new patient, doctors can use templates as doctor sets. These sets are predefined medication orders where doctors can use it if the patient
                  has the same medication order from past patients. 
            - Unclear value proposition: As data scientist, you must convey the system to non-technical people in the medical staff. This is important for medical staff
              to see the value of CPOE. 
            - Complexity of medication data structure ---> doctors need to provide a lot of information before confirming the medication order. 
            - Integration of medication, laboratory results, diagnostics, imaging and other orders. 
                - Several clicks since there are a lot of information. Hence, IS needs to improve UX. 
            - Fewer mistakes?? This is questionable.
                - If you have 2 drugs. The CPOE will sort the drug names. 
                    - CARDURA (trade name, enlarge prostate) ====> cArdURA 
                    - CORDALONE (anti-arrhythmic)            ====> cOrdALONE
                    - What if the doctor clicks the CARDURA instread of CORDALONE?
                        - Confirmation message. 
                        - Pharamcy use Tallman Lettering
            - CASE ISSUE: One of the most important lessons learned to date is that the complexity of human change management may be easily underestimated.
                - EMPHASIS: In many cases, health IT is not about the technology. It is about the information, management, and strategies. 
                - There may be resistance to other stakeholders in adopting these CPOE systems but IS people should convey the value of systems properly.
                - Different codes from different medical staffs may provide confusion among them. Hence, this confusion may produce errors and misdiagnosis. 
                - Usage: IPD, write the prescription, there was an impleemnt electronic CPOE. There is no space for the laptop due to spatial constraints. 
                        - Doctors go to the patient, write it on the paper. 
                - There is no one-best approach. It will always depend on the technology and issue available to the hospital. 
    
    Computerized (Nursing) Order Entry (CPOE)
        - Utilizing standards in nursing informatics - ICNP, Omaha
        - Populates and documents care-planning - What plan is needed for this patient? 
        - Incidence - Occurence Report 
        - ISSUES:
            - Nurses should have more time on the patients, not on the computers. BETTER Care
            - BETTER CARE vs BETTER DOCUMENTATION
            - Evolving standards in nursing management
    
    Computing (Pharamacy) Order Entry (CPOE)
        - Streamlinees workflow from medication orders 
        - ePrescribing is more correct term because orders can be sent to other institutions. 
        - ePrescription is only suited for medical orders within a single institution. 

    Stages of Medication Process and Closed Loop Medication Management 
        - Ordering ===> Transcription ===> Dispensing ===> Administration 
        - CPOE can help the Ordering and Transcription 
        - Dispensing: Automatic Medication Dispensing, Barcoded Medication Dispensing 
            - Dispensing is manual but the technology will help them if it is the correct patient and drug. 
            - Barcodes, RF, QR codes 
        - Administration: Electronic Medication Administration (eMAR), Barcoded Medication Administrtion Records (paper form ==> note the time)
        - eMAR allows you to timestamp the admin usage automaticallly. It can be used altogether with the BMAR.
        
        - Closed-Loop ====> Electronic

        - Not cost-effective to use robots or automatic dispension
            - Ramathibodi implemented automated dispensing 
            
    Pharmacy Applications 
        - ISSUES:
            - Who is entering the data for Dispensing stage: AMD and BMD? 
                - Why not nurses? 
                - Who enters medication orders into electronic format at which stage? 
                    - There may be unintend consequences: workarounds 
                    - Power shifts - The power shifts from one role into another. 
                        - When the doctor chooses the drug and pull it into the nurses stations, who has the most power?
                            - Doctors
                        - In the electronic world, nurses or the system has the most power? 
                        - By profession, the doctor commands someone. Doctors don't want losing power. They are trained with that personality. 
                        - We should be attentive to the power shifts. We are dealing with doctors that has strong dynamics. 
            - Handling exceptions - counter signs, verbal orders, emergencies, formulary replacements, drug shortages.
                - Verbal orders - giving medical prescriptions through telephones and other communication means 
                    - Can cause fragmented data 
                    - We can use voice recordings 
            - Example of WORKAROUND: Since medical students are not licensed, the students are not given with passwords to enter the data. 
                    - This is an issue of security. Hence, implement should a counter-sign feature in the CPOE system.
                    - Students may be able to log-in, given with their own password. Hence, students can provide medication orders but it will only serve as a draft order.
                    - Once the licensed doctors verify and check the students' medical prescriptions, they can counter-sign and confirm the order. 
            - Workflow facilitation vs medication safety. 
                    - Are you trying to remove the errors and improve the safety? Which is more important to you?

    IMAGING APPLICATION 
        - DICOM format --> standard imaging modalities. 
            - Values: reduces spaces, film costs, film loss, parallel viewing, remote access, image processing and manipulation, referrals. 
        - Radiology Infromation System or Workflow Management 
            - Workflow management part while the Imaging Applications is the picture part
        
    CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS 
        - expert systems based on AI, machine learning, rules and statistics
        - differential diagnosis and treatment options 
        - The real place wheere most of the alues of health IT can be achieved. The CDS is the top technique. 
        - Alerts and Reminders
            - Reminders are passive while alerts are activee 
            - Example of reminders: Facebook birthdays 
        - Pre-defined documents 
            - Order sets, personalized favorites, templaes for clinical notes 
            - Perfect example of Health Informatics is about I not T
        - Check List - you don't tend to think more. In another contet 
        - If you are the trainees, you are supposed to be the thinkers since it is important for the learning proecss. However, during the real-world practice, checklist 
          can still reduce the errors. Check list is introduced as a mechanism to help medical doctors. 
        - Simple UI designed to help clinical decision making
            - Abnormal lab highlights 
            - Graph/Visualization for lab results 
            - Filters and sorting functions  
        - Read the Elson, Faughnan, and Connelley (1997)

    DIGITAL HEALTH TRANSFORMATION 
        - DHT: Service is patient-focused
        - Rise of the Machines?
        - Digitizing Healthcare: The Digital Hospital? 
            - The doctor is not human? 
            - It is not about the technology.

        - Teenage Sex of IT 
            - Big data is like teenage sex. 
        - Nearly every technology follows this trend. For instance, Deep Learning has a hype cycle, similar to other emerging technologies like IoT, Brain-Computer Interface
        - The limitations of human doctors. Most of the symptoms are not specific and AI may or may not be helpful in diagnosing the patient. 
            - AI might think about the common types of symptoms. But there are pieces of information that the doctor might have missed. 
            - Some symptoms are not entirely specific. AI systems can be helpful in diagnosis but it is not entirely accurate. 
            - Most diagnosis are not diagnosed by diagnositc criteria, but by [atterns of clinical presentation and perceived likeliood of different diseases given available information 
                - Human is good at pattern recognition, while machine is good at logic and computations. 
            - There is a pattern. The world works in patterns.
