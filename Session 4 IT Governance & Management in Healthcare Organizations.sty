IT Governance and Management in Healthcare Organizations 

A. Context
    - What are the indications?
        - Suppose we are sailing on a small boat. What are the factors do we need to reach our vision, mission, goals (VMG)? 
            - Destination: this is the mission 
            - In Ramathibodi Hospital - vision is to become the top medical school
            - Your direction and speed are important factors to get to the destination. The strength and stability of the boat, including its tools, can be helpgul
              in your journey to the destination. These materials include the sail anf the boat. 
            - The tailwind, while you cannot control it, can be used to get to the direction. 
            
B. Know Your Context and Align IT with Context
    - Know your context! 
    - Use the SMART criteria
        - specific, measurable, achievable, relevant/realistic, time-bounded
        - strategy: plan of actions 
        - Strategic goals (HOW), Mission (WHERE), Vision (WHAT/WHY)
        - When we talk about the vision, we use the SMART criteria. 
            - Smart: Shared vision = shared commitment --> leading to greater vision 
                    - A broad vision may intersect/overlap to other vision of other Organizations
            - Measurable: How can we ensure that we're already in our destination?
                    - We use performance strategies
            - Achievable/Attainable
            - Relevant
        - 'Our goal is to land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth by the end of the decade' - President John F. Kennedy

C. Technology + People + Process 
    - Organizational Culture
        - Conservative: Some poeple may not follow the Technology 
        - Healthcare is conservative. Siriraj is very conservative. Ramathibodi was created from Siriraj. 
    - Target customers, local competitions, inter-organizationl collaboration 
    
D. Moving Organizations with IT 
    - IT Doesn't Matter by Carr (2004)
    - Four quadrants of Hospital IT 
        - The upper parts (i.e., strategic) still matter when we pose the question 'Does IT Matter?'
        - 
E. IT as a Strategic Advantage
    - Resources/Capabilities
        - Is it valuable? People skills?
            - If valuable, is it non-substitutable, can be repalce by something better
                - If you have better versions that are more effective 
            - If else, competitive disadvantage by having that resource 
        - Is it non-substitutable?
            - Is it better substitution, it is rare
            - If not, not competitive necessity
        - Is it rare?
            - If no, it is not competitive parity 
            - If yes, it is difficult to copy
        - Is it inimitable? (difficult to copy)
            - If no, preemptive advantage (not sustainable) 
            - If yes, sustainable competitive advantage 
        - Try resouce: Data Science and Clinical Informatics Program 
        - Sustainable competitive advantage -- it still matter! 
        
F. Management Point: Identify your strategic IT assets 
    - Business Strategy = IT Strategies 
    - If you cannot link the vision and new server, there are no much value on that.  
    - Arguments: IT investment --> is it really needed?
