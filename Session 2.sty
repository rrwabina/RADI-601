Health informatics focuses on information - how it is extracted is not entirely under this scheme
Acquiring data insights from these structured and unstructured data are vital to obtain new information, knowledge, and wisdom. 

The manufacturing industry uses IT - computer vision, robots
- Assembly line
- Supply Chain, Operations Research 

Banks
- Queuing Theory, Logistics
- Systematic, Rule-based processes

Healthcare 
- Chaos -- Chaos Theory 
- Long queues
- Payment system 

Healthcare systems use linear programming techniques and IT database systems to manage all data and resources with a given limited resources.
Doctors:    fast-thinker, analytical, process-oriented, egoistic -- as coined by Time. 

            Dubbed as team leaders 
Nurse:      Mood swings, lot of demands
            Detail-oriented, meticulous, ridiculous

In a systematic way, banking and healthcare utilize an operation research process and management
- It includes a given input, processed by a black-box method that will produce an output 
- Similarities: Value-Added, i.e., security, convenience, customer service

In mathematics, we use uncertainty quantification process to manage large variation and inconsistencies
clinical judgement 


Information --> clinical improvements of a patient, i.e., doctor acquiring clinical updates from a patient 
            --> monitoring KPI in hospital management
            --> insurance claims for health-related spending 

Biomedical Informatics in the Education of Physicians (Edward Shortliffe, MD, PhD)

Health IT ----> use of information and communiications technology for health 
eHealth ~ Health It
Dimesnions of high quality care: safe, timely, effective, patient-centered, efficient, equitable

High-Quality Care
    Drug:   If there are complications, i.e., bleeding
            Stroke: How do you distinguish? Imaging, CT scan --> takes time
            Stroke FAST Track System
    ABC: Airway, Breathing, and Circulation --> important things in diagnosis

    Diabetes retinopathy --> Doctors need to check the eyes of the patients annually sincec it may produce diabetic retinopathy 

    Engagement of the medical staff to the patient --> Patient-centered 
    It is vital that patients also participate in the diagnosis process
    Equitable: equity vs equality 

Unintended consequences of Health It
- poor quality and reduced safety 


Attention - interruption, may disrupt safety-centerednes

Medication Errors:
- Mathematically, this can be reduced using Uncertainty Quantification with Latent Diffusion Models - Stochastic Differential Matrices throug Wiener Process
- Smoking cessation treatment - modified human behaviour --> Failure to follow clinical practice guidelines
